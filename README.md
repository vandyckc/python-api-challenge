# python-api-challenge
In this project we we are analyzing weather patterns using APIs in python. First, we create scatter plots to show the relationship between certain weather patterns based on the latitudes and longitudes of randomly sampled cities across the world, computing linear regression for each relationship and explaining the findings. Second, we create a hypothetical vacation search looking for our ideal weather conditions within our previously sampled cities and locating and geographically mapping nearby hotels.

The code in this project comes from provided starter code, classwork examples, and bits and pieces of ChatGPT help. I also referenced pandas documentation for certain aspects of the mapping and charting.
